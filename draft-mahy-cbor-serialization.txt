1.  Introduction

   The serialization options for CBOR have been a source of confusion
   both among implementers and inside the IETF community.  Some reasons
   for this confusion include the following.

   *  Map ordering recommendations changed between [RFC7049] and
      [RFC8949].

   *  The non-normative nature of some of the guidance.

   *  Ambiguous language such as "preferred" used inside descriptions in
      the serializations.

   *  A large number of terms, some of which share the same initialisms
      (ex: common deterministic encoding, CBOR deterministic encoding)
      or include the name of one of the serializations.

   *  the verbosity of the descriptions

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Existing CBOR Serializations

   The following CBOR serializations are defined in [RFC8949].  Their
   definitions are clarified here.

   CBOR defines three specific serializations: common, basic.  These
   build on each other.

3.1.  Common Serialization

   *  integers and tags are always expressed using the smallest size
      representation possible.

   *  integers smaller than 2^xx MUST NOT be expressed as bigints. use
      the corresponding integer types instead.

   *  the major byte for definite-length byte strings, text strings,
      arrays, and maps is always expressed using the smallest number of
      bytes that can represent that length.

   *  floating point values are expressed using smallest of the three
      sizes (16-bits, 32-bits, or 64-bits) which can represent that
      value.

   *  Unlike for integers, common serialization does not place any
      restriction on the expression of bigfloats or bigfractions.

   *  floating point numbers which are mathematically integers (ex: 5.0
      or -3.0) are expressed as floating point numbers.

   *  Floating point negative zero (-0.0) is distinct from floating
      point positive zero (0.0)

   *  Floating point NaN values with payloads are distinct from one
      another.

3.2.  Basic Serialization

   Basic serialization did not exist in [RFC8949].  It includes all the
   requirements of Common serialization and adds one more.

   *  indefinite encoding is forbidden

3.3.  Ordered Serialization

   This was formally called "Deterministic Encoding" (which was
   confusing as the community often described any of these three
   serializations, and occasionally application-defined proffiles,
   collectively as CBOR Deterministic Encoding or CDE).

   Ordered Serialization includes all the requirements of Basic
   Serialization and adds one additional requirements.

   *  CBOR maps are sorted by lexicographically by the ordered CBOR
      serialization of their map keys.  See Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8949].

      Note that a CBOR map key can be another map key.  Therefore, to
      use ordered serialization, a CBOR map key must be (recursively)
      represented using Ordered Serialization.

4.  Application-specific Serialization Profiles

   Applications can define their own serialization rules, which may
   build from any of the three concrete serializations defined in this
   document, or from none of them.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
