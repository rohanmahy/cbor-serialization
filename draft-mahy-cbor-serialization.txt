1.  Introduction

   The serialization options for CBOR have been a source of confusion
   both among implementers and inside the IETF community.  Some reasons
   for this confusion include the following.

   *  Map ordering recommendations changed between [RFC7049] and
      [RFC8949].

   *  The non-normative nature of some of the guidance.

   *  Ambiguous language such as "preferred" used inside descriptions in
      the serializations.

   *  A large number of terms, some of which share the same initialisms
      (ex: common deterministic encoding, CBOR deterministic encoding)
      or include the name of one of the serializations.

   *  the verbosity of the descriptions

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Existing CBOR Serializations

   The following CBOR serialization are defined in [RFC8949].  Their
   definitions are clarified here.

   CBOR defines three specific serializations: common, basic.  These
   build on each

3.1.  Common Serialization

   *  integers are always expressed using the smallest size
      representation possible.

   *  integers smaller than 2^xx MUST NOT be expressed as bigints. use
      the corresponding integer types instead.


3.2.  Basic Serialization

   *  indefinite encoding is forbidden

3.3.  Ordered Serialization

   This was formally called "Deterministic Encoding".  This is confusing
   as the community often described all three serializations
   collectively as deterministic encoding.

   *  CBOR maps are sorted lexicographically by the CBOR serilization of
      their map keys.  See Section 4.2.1 of [RFC8949].

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
